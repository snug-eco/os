        <h1>Filesystem</h1>
        <pre>
The filesystem is flat and does not model any hierarchy.
Organizational hierarchy may be achieved through leveled identifiers.
        </pre>

        <h3>Implementation</h3>
        <pre>
The filesystem is implemented as a append-log.
Each file consists of a header, followed by the content of the file.
The header stores the name of the file, its hash (of the name), its length and an activity as well as validity flag.
When creating a file, the end of the log is sought and a new file is appended to the log.
When deleting a file, it is marked as inactive which cases it to be ignored in searches.
Locating a file in the system involves walking over the sequence of files and comparing hashes, then names.
The origin of the next file header is computed by advancing given the size of the current file.
        </pre>
        
        <h3>Garbage Collection</h3>
        <pre>
A GC (garbage collection) pass involves deleting the files marked as inactive 
and coping over the active files to prevent fragmentation.
Such a GC pass has to place from time to time to ensure the efficiency of the system.
GC passes may be preformed by the operating system itself or by external tools.
