        <h1>Outline</h1>
        <pre>
The system is comprised of three main components, hardware wise:
- The ATmega1284P-PU which acts as the processor.
- A SD-Card over SPI, which acts as the mass storage device.
- A UART-to-USB convert which acts as the terminal interface.
        </pre>

        <h1>UART Terminal</h1>
        <pre>
            The uart terminal is connect over on-board UART controller 1.
            Ergo, port D, RX on PD2 and TX on PD3.
        </pre>

        <h1>SD mass storage</h1>
        <pre>
            The SD card is connect over the on-board SPI controller.
            PB7 is SCK, PB0 is CS (SS), PD6 is MISO, PD5 is MOSI.
            There is a 100k Ohm pull-up resister to protect the CS on PB0 from accidentally activating.
