        <h1>Outline</h1>
        <pre>
The system is comprised of three main components, hardware wise:
- The ATmega1284P-PU which acts as the processor.
- A SD-Card over SPI, which acts as the mass storage device.
- A UART-to-USB convert which acts as the terminal interface.
        </pre>

        <h1>UART Terminal</h1>
        <pre>
            The uart terminal is connect over on-board uart controller 1.
            Ergo, port D, RX on PD2 and TX on PD3.
        </pre>

        <h1>SD mass storage</h1>
        <pre>
            The SD card is connect over on-board uart controller 2 in MSPIM.
            PB0 is SCK, PB1 is CS (SS), PD0 is MISO, PD1 is MOSI.
