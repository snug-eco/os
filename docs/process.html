        <h1>Process</h1>
        <pre>
A process can be launched from a file containing a binary program.
In the process's lifetime (active period) this binary program will be executed.
        </pre>

        <h3>Task Swapper</h3>
        <pre>
The task swapper distributes time between the active processes.
Each process gets to run until it either yields or exceeds 2000 instruction cycles.
Disk caching performance overhead is disregarded.
There is now priority between processes. Time is distributed round-robbin-style.
The act of going over and giving each process time is know as passing.
        </pre>
        
        <h3>Terminal IO</h3>
        <pre>
If a process wishes to output a character to the terminal, it yields until the transmit buffer is empty.
Processes read input indirectly from a cache, which is updated once per pass.
If a process has read the input character it is flag in the process control block for having done so,
and yields of it want another character. In this way the process waits for the pass to complete and
for the next character to become available.
